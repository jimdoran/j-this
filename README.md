J-this
=========
V.1

Press This is a bookmarklet: a little app that runs in your browser and lets you grab bits of the web.

Use Press This to clip text, images and videos from any web page. Then edit and add more straight from Press This before you save or publish it in a post on your site. The original Press This bookmarklet is found in the admin area of WordPress (Settings -> Writing)

j-this.php is a modified version of Press This that removes some default formatting. 

1) Upload j-this.php to the wp-admin folder.
2) Modify the bookmarklet text, replacing "http://sitename.com/wordpress-path/wp-admin/j-this.php" with the correct path to your own site. Note: 
3) Create a bookmark in your browser or modify the existing bookmarklet with the JavaScript from line 2.
